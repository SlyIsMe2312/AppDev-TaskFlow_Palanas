   ```
   *OR* manually download the ZIP and extract it.

2. Move the entire **TaskFlow** folder into `htdocs` inside your XAMPP directory:
   - Example path: `C:\xampp\htdocs\TaskFlow` (Windows)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start XAMPP Services
1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**.
2. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** by clicking the **Start** button.
3. Click **Admin** next to MySQL to open phpMyAdmin in your browser.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Database
1. In **phpMyAdmin**, click **New** to create a new database.
2. Open the `create_database.txt` file inside the **TaskFlow** folder.
3. Copy and paste the SQL query into phpMyAdmin and run it to set up the database.

1. Open your web browser.
2. Type `http://localhost/TaskFlow/` in the address bar and press **Enter**.
